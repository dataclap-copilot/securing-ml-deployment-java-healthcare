# ☁️ Securing ML Model Deployment in Healthcare (Java Edition)

This project showcases a secure, compliant, and production-ready deployment of a machine learning (ML) model within a healthcare environment. Built using **Java (Spring Boot)**, the system is designed to meet **HIPAA compliance standards** with TLS encryption, audit logging, and role-based access control.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Healthcare data demands the highest level of privacy and integrity. This system securely serves ML predictions over HTTPS and ensures:

- Protected health information (PHI) is never exposed in logs or errors
- All access is logged and auditable
- APIs are encrypted via TLS
- Compliant with security guidelines like HIPAA

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ **HIPAA-Compliant Infrastructure**  
- 🔒 **Secure Model Serving (HTTPS + TLS)**  
- 🧾 **Audit Logging of Access and Predictions**  
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control**  
- 🔁 **Ready for Cloud Native Deployment (Docker + Kubernetes)**
